# Wild Life Conservation 


* An academic project (DBMS)

* This project aims to help authorized wildlife conservation groups to track and maintain records of drastic population changes of various endangered and invasive species as well as the cause of death (COD).

* This project was build using python and uses sqlite3 for maintaining  the databases and tkinter for a simple GUI

* Initially setup.py is run to create and populate the database with the appropriate data (species , classification, population count, etcâ€¦)

* Once the initial setup has been completed and the database has been created, the second python script can be used to start and use the application
